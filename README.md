Advanced Schooling community is the platform where multiple schools can register and manage all their operations through a designated portal. On the other hand, any user can find the best nearby schools based on their rating. This is an ongoing project but as for now, we just implemented the module where we can register the students, Teachers, and Courses and we can create multiple quizzes. Students can attempt quizzes and get a score in response.
